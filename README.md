# CHD_ND_Property_Loss
The goal of this research is to investigate the correlation between greater community property losses and the increasing prevalence of hypertension resulting in the worsening of cardiovascular disease. This will be accomplished by separating the community property loss into clusters. The groups will be sectioned partial damage, minor damage, major damage, and severe damage.
